# Image saver web app

In this project, i used the Django framework and SQLite to make an image saver of GitHub accounts that uses Beautiful Soup to scrap the image URL inside of the pages

On this page, you can:

# Register, log in and have admin accounts with a database connected to Django

# Use the account to search for a GitHub account and using web scraping libraries it parses the part with the actual image to convert it into a readable URL

# Display for each account the images saved in a gallery view

# The used templates allow the user to have a dynamic and easy-to-understand design, using javascript, CSS and HTML for the front-end part of the project

# Made a model with the already included database that stores the actual image for any modification and display, based on the user
