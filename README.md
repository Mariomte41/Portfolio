# Image saver web app

In this project i used the django framework and sqlite to make an image saver of github accounts that uses beautiful soup to scrap the image url inside of the pages

In this page you can:

# Register, login and have admin accounts with a database connected to django

# Use the account to search for a github account and using web scraping libraries it parses the part with the actual image to convert it into a readable url

# Display for each account the images saved in a gallery view

# The used templates allow the user to have a dynamic and easy to understand design, using javascript, css and html for the front-end part of the project
