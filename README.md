# FACE RECOGNITION

In this project, I did a basic script to detect pre-saved images of faces so they can be detected using the opencv library and some mathematical functions to determine the average of confidence it has in a face recognition using the images as base, then displaying at the very center a red rectangle with the name of the image, it is a small project as it only needed some functions to:

# Read the image and process it

# Make the red rectangle display and the name when recognized

# Match the face in the image with the camera chosen in the script

# Make a percentage of the confidence and accuracy of the detection
